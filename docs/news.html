<h2>Next Meeting</h2>
<h3> Wednesday FEBRUARY 11, 2026 - 9:30 am to 1:30 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, Boone Station Hall
</h3>

<p>
Stop by and join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill or in need.  
  We’ll be working with our recent fabric and yarn donations.   
</p>
<p>

Come with questions, leave with fabric and/or yarn for your next project. The large room 
  and table space make it easy to assemble large blankets. Visit with friends and bring a 
  sack lunch if you wish to stay.
</p>
<p>
Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets and a rotary 
  cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other supplies are available. 
  In addition, if you can, please bring irons, ironing boards or ironing mats, sewing machines 
  and extension cords and let’s see how many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
</p>



<!--
  <p>
    Bring your finished blankets for Show and Tell, then spend time shopping the 
    fabric and yarn bins (we've got lots of both). 
    If anyone would like sport or baby yarns, let the Chapter Coordinator know as 
    soon as possible. There is a large bag of it that needs to go immediately.
  </p>

<b>SATURDAY WORK DAY</b>
<p>
  Stop by and join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill or in need.  
  We've been busily putting together new fabrics into kits, and we have lots of panels 
  that will be a great start on creating new quilts.  
</p><p>
Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets 
  and a rotary cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other 
  supplies are available. In addition, if you can, please bring irons, ironing 
  boards or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension cords and let’s see how 
  many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
  </p><p>
  We’ll also have a bin of “Last Chance” fabrics that have been 
  around for a while that will be passed onto another charity if they don’t go on Saturday.  
  Bring your finished blankets for Show and Tell, shop for fabric and yarn (we have a huge 
  collection of both).

<h2>News</h2>
<b>All crocheters and knitters:</b>
<p>
PLEASE please remember that the blankets you make may be subject to repeated 
washings and dryings and not necessarily on gentle settings.  
PLEASE make sure you weave in long ends (at least EIGHT INCHES OF YARN) each 
time  you change colors.  Recently several lovely knit/crochet blankets have 
literally disintegrated in the washer/dryer as an unsecured end in the middle 
has come out, leaving gaping holes in the blanket.
</p><p>
Also, we are suddenly receiving blankets with large holes in the pattern  that
might be great for a summer shawl, but are not suitable to provide comfort and
warmth to children in need.  If you are making a blanket for Project Linus, 
please select a blanket pattern with small or no holes in it. 
</p>
<p>Small balls of yarn are waiting to be adopted and made into corner to corner blankets.  
  Even if you are not a crocheter, come give it a try (someone will be happy to instruct 
  you!) - it’s fun, easy and a great way to use up the vast numbers of small balls of yarn 
  we have.
</p>

<b>All quilters:</b>
<p>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.
</p>
<p>With the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
    </p>

  LOOKING FOR A WAY TO DONATE TO OUR PROJECT LINUS CHAPTER?
<br>
Walmart has allowed us to set up a registry for folks who want to donate. We’ve placed a 
  selection of anti-pill fleece (1 1/2 yard packages) in it and our intrepid volunteer 
  Jane put it to the test.  It arrives at my house in a couple of days.  Go to 
  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/sparkgood">  Walmart.com/sparkgood </a>
  and type "Linus Project" in the search box. Click on the "Registry" button for the Annapolis chapter, 
  and then open the second registry “Homemade blankets….” If Walmart has items you want that aren’t 
  on the list, email us! We can add them.  Also, the registry can send you a donation receipt.
</p>

<p>  Dropoff locations are
  <ul>
    <li>Capital Vacuum and Sewing Center</li>
    <li>the Severna Park Community Center</li> 
    <li>Cottonwood Quilting, Arts and Antiques</li>
  </ul>
  Check our posted drop-off location addresses and hours on 
  the <a href="https://www.projectlinus.org/">https://www.projectlinus.org/</a>
  website under Find Chapters.
  Click the Blanket Drop button under Annapolis, MD to see Blanket Drop-Off 
  Sites: <a href="https://www.projectlinus.org/chapters/index.php?state=MD#tgt">

</p>
  
<p>
Frustrated with a project (material/yarn not laying right, too much or not 
  enough fabric/yarn, etc.)? Feel free to bring your problem project to our 
  meeting for help and advice.
</p>


  <p> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </p>  

<p>MATERIALS: <br>
  When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
  <br>
  When crafting blankets, please use machine washable yarns and fabrics, 
  and colors and patterns suitable for kids.
</p>

<p>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>
