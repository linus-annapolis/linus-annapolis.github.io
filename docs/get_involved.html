<p>
The blankets come in many styles; quilt, tied comforters, crochet, knit, edged fleece, no-sew fleece, etc. 
 No matter your skill level – there is a blanket style that you will enjoy! 
 Do you want to learn a new technique? Our monthly meetings often focus on learning new skills and many of 
 the ‘blanketeers’ are willing to provide one-on-one help. We also have a collection
of patterns and tutorials <a href="/docs/patterns_and_tutorials.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Project Linus is a rewarding and fun service organization that brings together people of all ages who want 
 to help children who are seriously ill, traumatized or otherwise in need.</p>

<p>Project Linus works with local businesses and service clubs (Girl Scouts, schools, church groups, etc.) 
 to assist them in reaching public service goals. Contact the Chapter Coordinator before you undertake 
 your project. </p>

<p>Come to every meeting or work from your home/office.
Project Linus makes participation easy and fun!</p>

<h1> Donate -- Here's How </h1>
<h2> Blankets </h2>

<p>Project Linus accepts donations of new, handmade blankets in sizes 32″ x 32″ and larger. 
 Blankets must be made of machine-washable materials and be in bright child-friendly colors and prints.
We have a collection of <a href="/docs/patterns_and_tutorials.html">patterns and tutorials</a> you 
 may find helpful. </p>

<h2> Materials - Direct </h2>

<p>If you have blanket-making materials (cotton fabrics & machine-washable yarn) that you would 
 like to donate, please contact the chapter coordinator first. </p>

<p>Contact information can be found <a href="/docs/contact.html">here</a></p>

<h2> Materials - Walmart Registry </h2>

<p> Walmart has allowed us to set up a registry for folks who want to donate. We’ve placed a 
  selection of anti-pill fleece (1 1/2 yard packages) in it and our intrepid volunteer 
  Jane put it to the test.  It arrives at my house in a couple of days.   
  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/registry/RR/2ed9de14-747e-4549-95fc-2df6394cb320">  
    Click here for the registry </a>.
  If Walmart has items you want that aren’t 
  on the list, email us! We can add them.  Also, the registry can send you a donation receipt.
</p>
