<h2> NEXT MEETING</h2>
<h3> Wednesday, November 6, 2024 -- 10 am to 1:30 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Boone Station Hall (BSH)</i></b>
</h3>
<b>BLANKET WORK DAY</b>
<p>
  We’ll be working with our recent fabric donations. We’ll also be getting 
  smaller pieces of fleece that have been cut into squares and  assembled 
  into multi-colored quilts sewn into finished blankets - BRING YOUR SEWING MACHINES.  
</p>

<p>Come with questions, leave with fabric and/or yarn for your next project. 
  The large room and table space make it easy to assemble large blankets. 
  Visit with friends and bring a sack lunch if you wish to stay.
</p>

<p>Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished 
  blankets and a rotary cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting 
  mats and other supplies are available. In addition, if you can, please 
  bring irons, ironing boards or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension cords 
  and let’s see how many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<p>
  SMALLER BLANKETS NEEDED: One of the baby pantries we 
  serve asked for 72 toddler sized blankets that we’d like 
  to get to them by year's end, 
  so for a bit, please concentrate on these. They  
  need to be a minimum size of 30” by 30” (we’ll make an 
  exception to the size rule below)
</p>
<p>
CROCHETERS: We have a large number of fleece pieces with 
  holes punched ready for crochet around with yarns to go 
  with, although you are free to swap out other yarns if you 
  prefer. Please return any unused yarns for others to use.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  
<li>It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
  Last year between the schools and the Stanton Center we donated 
  380 double fleece blankets!  The demand will likely be higher this year - 
  so get sewing!
</li>

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>

<li>Dropoff locations are now the JoAnn Fabrics in Annapolis, the Severna Park 
  Community Center, and the new quilt shop just opened in Severna Park - Cottonwood 
  Quilting, Arts and Antiques at 548 Benfield Road in the Benfield Village Shopping Center 
  at Benfield and Jumper’s Hole Roads (alongside the Szechuan Inn).  
  They’ve made space in their kitchen, so let them know that you are dropping 
  off blankets for Project Linus.</li>
