<b>Quilters' Feeding Frenzy</b>
<p>
  Join us for a shopping expedition! Some of our intrepid volunteers have 
  been busy pulling our huge collection of donated fabric together into 
  kits ready to be made into quilts for the kids we serve.  We’ll also have a 
  bin of “Last Chance” fabrics that have been around for a while that will be 
  passed onto another charity if they don’t go on Saturday. To our knitters and 
  crocheters - even you might be tempted by the 
  appealing fabrics that say “take me - make me into a quilt for a needy child!”
</p>
<p>
Also, bring your finished blankets for Show and Tell.  
  The blanket pictured below was recently donated 
  and is worthy of close inspection - so come and see it!

<h2>News</h2>
<p>
  <b>BREAKING NEWS!</b> JoAnn Fabrics was sold to a liquidator 
  and ALL stores will be closing by the 
  end of May.  For the time being, we can still use the Annapolis 
  store as a drop off location, 
  but stay tuned as we look for a new location.

  <b>Scrappy Sewing With Patty Fundraiser Continues!</b>
  <br>
  We all have scraps! Sign-ups will start on February 15th, 2025; 
  and the first pattern release is March 8th. When  signing up, 
  you will get a cutting guide that will help you prepare scraps 
  for the patterns. Every other week for three months, everyone 
  who signs up will get a one-page color pattern with complete 
  directions to make a quilt. These patterns could also use yardage 
  but are designed to use scraps like 2 1/2-inch and 5-inch squares 
  and various strips and rectangles. If you liked the All Boxed In 
  pattern, you will love these patterns. Our chapter can benefit. 
  There is a Facebook group called Scrappy Sewing with Patty that 
  anyone can join. This is a second opportunity when the entire $20 
  gets credited to the Chapter so long as you remember to list the 
  ANNAPOLIS Chapter in your registration.
</p>
  <p>
  It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
    Last year we donated 426 double fleece blankets!  The 
    demand will likely be higher this year - so get sewing!
</p><p>
All quilters, crocheters and knitters...
<br>
Frustrated with a project (material/yarn not laying right, too much or not 
  enough fabric/yarn, etc.)? Feel free to bring your problem project to our 
  meeting for help and advice.
</p>

<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>

<li>Dropoff locations are the JoAnn Fabrics in Annapolis, the Severna Park 
  Community Center, Cottonwood 
  Quilting, Arts and Antiques at 548 Benfield Road in the Benfield Village Shopping Center 
  at Benfield and Jumper’s Hole Roads (alongside the Szechuan Inn).  
  </li>
</ul>
