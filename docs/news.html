<h2> NEXT MEETING</h2>
<h3> Saturday JULY 19, 2025 --- 10:00 am to NOON
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Boone Station Hall (BSH)</i></b>
</h3>

<b>SATURDAY WORK DAY</b>
<p>
  Stop by and join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill or in need.  
  We've been busily putting together new fabrics into kits, and we have lots of panels 
  that will be a great start on creating new quilts.  
</p><p>
Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets 
  and a rotary cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other 
  supplies are available. In addition, if you can, please bring irons, ironing 
  boards or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension cords and let’s see how 
  many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
  </p><p>
  We’ll also have a bin of “Last Chance” fabrics that have been 
  around for a while that will be passed onto another charity if they don’t go on Saturday.  
  Bring your finished blankets for Show and Tell, shop for fabric and yarn (we have a huge 
  collection of both).

<b>Blanket Work Day</b>
<p>
  Stop by and join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill or in need.  
  We’ll be working with our recent fabric and yarn donations.   
</p>
<p>
Come with questions, leave with fabric and/or yarn for your next project. The large 
  room and table space make it easy to assemble large blankets. Visit with friends 
  and bring a sack lunch if you wish to stay.

  <p>
  It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
    Last year we donated 426 double fleece blankets!  The 
    demand will likely be higher this year - so get sewing!  
    
</p><p>
All quilters, crocheters and knitters...
<br>
Frustrated with a project (material/yarn not laying right, too much or not 
  enough fabric/yarn, etc.)? Feel free to bring your problem project to our 
  meeting for help and advice.
</p>

<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>
