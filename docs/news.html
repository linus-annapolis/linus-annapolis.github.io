<b> There's snow in the forecast! 
We'll post here if the meeting is cancelled due to weather, but our Facebook page will probably be updated sooner. 
</b>
    <br>
    Join the Anne Arundel County Group of Project Linus at an <b>AFTERNOON MEETING</b> on Saturday, <b>February 17, 
      2024</b>, from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., at the Severna Park Community Center, <b>MAGOTHY ROOM</b>, 623 
    Baltimore-Annapolis Blvd., Severna Park, MD 21146. Volunteer Sandy Campbell will demonstrate how to braid the edges of double fleece 
    blankets, which is a quick way of making those Backpack Buddy Blankets (October will creep up on us before 
    we know it!).  Pick up fabric or yarn for your next project, bring blankets that you’re especially proud of 
    for the Show and Tell.

    We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  
    The job entails finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or 
    quilting topic, handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  
    We’ve got a bin full of items for door prizes.  
    If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!

    <b>Severna Park Joann Fabrics Closing Soon</b><br>
    The Severna Park Joann Fabrics will be closing in the very near future.  They're currently offering substantial discounts on remaining inventory.
    <p>
    The Severna Park store will no longer be a Project Linus drop-off location. 
      Our other locations will continue to be active. These are the Annapolis Joann Fabrics store and the reception desk of the Severna Park Community Center.
