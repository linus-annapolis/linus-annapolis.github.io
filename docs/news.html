<h2> NEXT MEETING: Wednesday, July 10, 2024 10 am to 1:30 pm
  <br>Severna Park Community Center, Boone Station Hall
</h2>
<b>BLANKET WORK DAY</b>

<p>
  Join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill 
  or in need.  We’ll be getting fleece ready for 
  Backpack Buddy blankets and for crocheted edges, and bundling our recent 
  fabric donations into kits ready to go and 
  sewing some of those kits.  Come with questions, 
  leave with fabric and/or yarn for your next project.

</p><p>

The large room and table 
  space make it easy to assemble large blankets. 
  Visit with friends and bring a sack lunch if 
  you wish to stay.

</p><p>

Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels 
  on finished blankets and a rotary cutter to help 
  make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other 
  supplies are available. In addition, if you can, 
  please bring irons, ironing boards or ironing mats, 
  sewing machines and extension cords and let’s see how 
  many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
</p>

<hr>
<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National sent out a message that a child had been hurt by a pin left in a seam. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
  Last year between the schools and the Stanton Center we donated 
  380 double fleece blankets!  The demand will likely be higher this year - 
  so get sewing!
</li>

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>
<li>At the recent retreat, it was announced that Project Linus has now donated more 
  than 10,000,000 blankets!
  </li>
</ul>
