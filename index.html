<h1>Mission Statement</h1>
<p>Project Linus is a nationwide non-profit organization with a two-fold mission.</p>

<p>First: It is our mission to provide love, a sense of security, warmth and 
  comfort to children who are seriously ill, traumatized, or otherwise in need 
  through the gifts of new handmade blankets and afghans, lovingly created by volunteer “blanketeers.”</p>

<p>Second: It is our mission to provide a rewarding and fun service opportunity 
  for interested individuals and groups in local chapters</p>
