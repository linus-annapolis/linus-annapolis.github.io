<h2> NEXT MEETING</h2>
<h3> Wednesday May 7 -- 9:30 am to 1:30 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Boone Station Hall (BSH)</i></b>
</h3>
<b>Blanket Work Day</b>
<p>
  Stop by and join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill or in need.  
  We’ll be working with our recent fabric and yarn donations.   
</p>
<p>
Come with questions, leave with fabric and/or yarn for your next project. The large 
  room and table space make it easy to assemble large blankets. Visit with friends 
  and bring a sack lunch if you wish to stay.
</p>
<p>
Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets and a rotary 
  cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other supplies are available.
  In addition, if you can, please bring irons, ironing boards 
  or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension cords and let’s see how many more 
  blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<p>
  NEEDED!  Baby blankets. The Partnership for Children, 
  Youth and Families has asked us to participate in the 
  Brooklyn Park Community Baby Shower on May 31st and 
  requested 75 baby blankets for these north county 
  expectant mothers.  This is a service deficit area 
  with a needy population.  Please help us meet that goal!
</p>

<p>
  Dropoff locations are now Capital Vacuum and 
  Sewing Center, the Severna Park Community Center and 
  Cottonwood Quilting, Arts and Antiques. 
  Check our posted drop-off location addresses and hours on 
  the https://www.projectlinus.org/ website under Find Chapters.

  <p>
  It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
    Last year we donated 426 double fleece blankets!  The 
    demand will likely be higher this year - so get sewing!  
    The good news is that we cleaned out the Annapolis JoAnn’s 
    Fabrics when they reduced prices sufficiently just before 
    they closed to help make a dent in the amount of fleece we 
    need (we were able to purchase about 25% of the fleece we 
    need with the donation from Sam’s Club)!
</p><p>
All quilters, crocheters and knitters...
<br>
Frustrated with a project (material/yarn not laying right, too much or not 
  enough fabric/yarn, etc.)? Feel free to bring your problem project to our 
  meeting for help and advice.
</p>

<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>
