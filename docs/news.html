<dt> Next Meeting: March 16, 2024 </dt>
  <dd><b> Quilters ahoy! </b>
Join the Anne Arundel County Group of Project Linus at an AFTERNOON MEETING on Saturday, 
    March 16, 2024, from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m., at the Severna Park Community Center, 
    MAGOTHY ROOM, 623 Baltimore-Annapolis Blvd., Severna Park, MD 21146. 
    <br>
We’ll be focused on our quilters for this meeting as we have received a large donation 
    of beautiful quilting cotton. We invite the quilters to come and choose fabric for 
    their next Project Linus quilts.  We’ll have tables and cutting mats available to get 
    your next quilts up and running!
    <br>
We’ll also have a table of “Last Chance” fabrics that have been around for a while 
    that will be passed onto another charity if they don’t go on Saturday.  There will 
    be no fleece at this meeting, but we will have the bags of donated yarn available 
    for our knitters and crocheters.

    We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  
    The job entails finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or 
    quilting topic, handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  
    We’ve got a bin full of items for door prizes.  
    If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!
