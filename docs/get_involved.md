The blankets come in many styles; quilt, tied comforters, crochet, knit, edged fleece, no-sew fleece, etc. No matter your skill level – there is a blanket style that you will enjoy! Do you want to learn a new technique? Our monthly meetings often focus on learning new skills and many of the ‘blanketeers’ are willing to provide one-on-one help.

Project Linus is a rewarding and fun service organization that brings together people of all ages who want to help children who are seriously ill, traumatized or otherwise in need.

Project Linus works with local businesses and service clubs (Girl Scouts, schools, church groups, etc.) to assist them in reaching public service goals. Contact the Chapter Coordinator before you undertake your project. 

Come to every meeting or work from your home/office.
Project Linus makes participation easy and fun!
