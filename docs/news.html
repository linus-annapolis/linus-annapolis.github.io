<h2> NEXT MEETINGS</h2>
<h3> Wednesday OCTOBER 15, 2025 -- 9:00 am to 1:30 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Boone Station Hall (BSH)</i></b>
</h3>

<b>SPECIAL TOY-MAKING SESSION</b>
<p>
The Anne Arundel County Public Schools Birth to Five Family Outreach program is 
  hosting a Resource Fair and Trunk or Treat event on October 28th in Glen Burnie.


</p><p>
We have been asked to participate to talk about Project Linus.  They have asked the 
  exhibitors to have non-edible giveaways.  With the massive quantities of yarn and 
  scraps of fleece and batting or fill on hand, we’re going to make small toys that 
  we can distribute.
</p><p>
Although we’re hoping that many of you will work on these toys on your own, we’ve 
  reserved Boone Station Hall on Wednesday October 15th from 9:00 am to 1:30 pm to 
  work on them together.
</p><p>
We have yarn, fleece scraps and batting for stuffing.  Please come join us to produce 
  as many cute little toys as we can!
</p><p>
Get in touch with any questions.  Hope to see you all there!
  </p>

<h3> Saturday OCTOBER 18, 2025 -- 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Magothy Room</i></b>
</h3>
<b>SPECIAL CHALLENGE MEETING</b>

<p>Come learn about Sandy S.’s challenge to quilters to be creative with snowman quilt panels.  
  (She ordered one panel and received an entire bolt so there should be enough panels for all who 
  are interested). Snowman square is approximately 18” X 21” and Panel is 36" X 42". Create what you 
  would like and bring it back to the December meeting!

</p><p>

We’ll also be spending time working on stuffed toys for the Resource Fair and Trunk or Treat event 
  on October 28th in Glen Burnie being put on by the Anne Arundel County Public Schools Birth to 
  Five Family Outreach program.  We’ve got lots of yarns, stuffing and other stuff - so put on 
  your creativity beanies and come join in the fun.

</p><p>

We’ll also have a bin of “Last Chance” fabrics that have been around for a while that will 
  be passed onto another charity if they don’t go on Saturday.  Bring your finished blankets 
  for Show and Tell, shop for fabric and yarn (we have a huge collection of both).

</p>
<!--
<b>SATURDAY WORK DAY</b>
<p>
  Stop by and join volunteers in making blankets for children who are ill or in need.  
  We've been busily putting together new fabrics into kits, and we have lots of panels 
  that will be a great start on creating new quilts.  
</p><p>
Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets 
  and a rotary cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other 
  supplies are available. In addition, if you can, please bring irons, ironing 
  boards or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension cords and let’s see how 
  many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.

<h2>News</h2>

<p>Small balls of yarn are waiting to be adopted and made into corner to corner blankets.  
  Even if you are not a crocheter, come give it a try (someone will be happy to instruct 
  you!) - it’s fun, easy and a great way to use up the vast numbers of small balls of yarn we have.</p>
<p>
  LOOKING FOR A WAY TO DONATE TO OUR PROJECT LINUS CHAPTER?

Walmart has allowed us to set up a registry for folks who want to donate. We’ve placed a 
  selection of anti-pill fleece (1 1/2 yard packages) in it and our intrepid volunteer 
  Jane put it to the test.  It arrives at my house in a couple of days.  Go to 
  <a href="https://www.walmart.com/sparkgood">  Walmart.com/sparkgood </a>
  and type "Linus Project" in the search box. Click on the "Registry" button for the Annapolis chapter, 
  and then open the second registry “Homemade blankets….” If Walmart has items you want that aren’t 
  on the list, email us! We can add them.  Also, the registry can send you a donation receipt.
</p>
<p>
  New recipients:  We’ve been contacted by the local US Navy’s Fleet and Family Support Center 
  requesting 200-300 blankets for the children with special needs of active duty military  
  (babies to 14 years of age). 
  There is no deadline, but let's try to meet this request by the year-end holidays.  
  Any style of blanket will be accepted.
</p>

  <p>
  It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
    Last year we donated 426 double fleece blankets!  The 
    demand will likely be higher this year - so get sewing!  
    
</p><p>
All quilters, crocheters and knitters...
<br>
Frustrated with a project (material/yarn not laying right, too much or not 
  enough fabric/yarn, etc.)? Feel free to bring your problem project to our 
  meeting for help and advice.

<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>
