<h2> NEXT MEETING</h2>
<h3> Saturday, September 21, 2024 -- 2 pm to 4 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Magothy Room</i></b>
</h3>
<b>AFTERNOON MEETING</b>
<p>
  We’ll be focused on our quilters for this meeting as we have received several 
  large donations of beautiful quilting cotton and invite the quilters to come and 
  choose fabric for their next Project Linus quilt.  We’ll have tables, cutting mats 
  and other supplies available to get your next quilts up and running!  Please bring a 
  needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets. In addition, if you can, 
  please bring irons, ironing boards or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension 
  cords and let’s see how many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting. 
  There may be some fleece at this meeting for crochet around, and we will have the 
  bags of donated yarn available for our knitters and crocheters.
</p>
<p>
We’ll also have a bin of “Last Chance” fabrics that have been around for a while 
  that will be passed onto another charity if they don’t go on Saturday.
</p>
<p>Also, bring your finished blankets for Show and Tell.

<p>Please join us for our 2024 Project Linus Quilt Challenge!

REGISTRATION is open: Aug 8—Sept 30 PATTERN and VIDEOS AVAILABLE: Sept 3. 
  Please designate the: ANNAPOLIS Chapter of Project Linus as the recipient of your donation. Thank you!</p>


<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National sent out a message that a child had been hurt by a pin left in a seam. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  
<li>It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
  Last year between the schools and the Stanton Center we donated 
  380 double fleece blankets!  The demand will likely be higher this year - 
  so get sewing!
</li>

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>

<li>Dropoff locations are now the JoAnn Fabrics in Annapolis and the Severna Park Community Center.  
  We’ll be looking for a spot further north in the county. Let us know if you have any 
  suggestions for places</li>
</ul>
