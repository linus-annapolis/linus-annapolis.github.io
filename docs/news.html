<h2> NEXT MEETING</h2>
<h3> Wednesday January 8 -- 10:00 am to 1:30 pm
  <br>
  Severna Park Community Center, <b><i>Boone Station Hall (BSH)</i></b>
</h3>
<b>Blanket Work Day</b>
<p>
  Stop by the Severna Park Community Center, Boone Station Hall (BSH), 
   and join volunteers in making blankets for 
  children who are ill or in need.  We’ll be working with our recent fabric and yarn donations.   

</p>
<p>

Come with questions, leave with fabric and/or yarn for your next project. 
  The large room and table space make it easy to assemble large blankets. 
  Visit with friends and bring a sack lunch if you wish to stay.

</p>
<p>

Please bring a needle and thread to help sew labels on finished blankets and a 
  rotary cutter to help make fleece ready to use. Cutting mats and other supplies 
  are available. In addition, if you can, please bring irons, ironing boards 
    or ironing mats, sewing machines and extension cords and let’s see how 
  many more blankets we can turn out during the meeting.
</p>

<h2>News</h2>
<p>
  The December Holiday party was well attended with lots of wonderful nibbles and 
  beautiful blankets for Show and Tell.  Someone left a tray that 
  says “The Giving Plate”  Please claim it!  Thanks
</p>
  <p>
  Our birthday fairy has indicated that the birthday list is out of date.  
  If you like the idea of receiving a greeting from your friends at 
  Project Linus on your birthday, we’ll have a sign-up sheet for month and day
  (no year necessary) and address.  Or email the Chapter Coordinator and 
  she’ll add you to the list.
</p><p>
All quilters, crocheters and knitters...
<br>
Frustrated with a project (material/yarn not laying right, too much or not 
  enough fabric/yarn, etc.)? Feel free to bring your problem project to our 
  meeting for help and advice.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Reminders</h2>
<ul>
  <li>QUILTERS: with the fabulous fabric donations we’ve received, 
    we have a mix of washed and unwashed fabrics.  Please be sure all fabrics 
    are washed before cutting and sewing, to avoid uneven shrinkage in 
    your finished item.
  </li>
  <li>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU’VE REMOVED ALL PINS before donating a blanket. 
    PL National has reported that TWO children had been hurt by pins 
    left in a seam.  As a result, ALL BLANKETS need to be brought to a 
    meeting or dropped off at a drop off point and then taken to a meeting 
    so that each and every one can be vetted by another person. 
    When labeling blankets, please check carefully for any errant pins.</li>

<li>PLEASE HAND-SEW LABELS ON SECURELY. They are still coming off in the 
  washing machine.</li>

  <li> MINIMUM acceptable size is 32” by 32”  
 That's larger than national PL rules -- this is a chapter-specific request. 
    Larger is always better!
  </li>  
<li>It’s never too soon to work on Backpack Buddy blankets.  
  Last year between the schools and the Stanton Center we donated 
  380 double fleece blankets!  The demand will likely be higher this year - 
  so get sewing!
</li>

<li>When donating yarn, PLEASE give it to the Chapter Coordinator and DO NOT put 
  it directly into the yarn bins (We’ve been getting too many wool and wool blends, 
  which we can’t use for Project Linus blankets)
</li>

<li>We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  The job entails 
    finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or quilting topic, 
    handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  We’ve got a bin full of items for door 
    prizes.  If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!</li>

<li>Dropoff locations are now the JoAnn Fabrics in Annapolis, the Severna Park 
  Community Center, and the new quilt shop just opened in Severna Park - Cottonwood 
  Quilting, Arts and Antiques at 548 Benfield Road in the Benfield Village Shopping Center 
  at Benfield and Jumper’s Hole Roads (alongside the Szechuan Inn).  
  They’ve made space in their kitchen, so let them know that you are dropping 
  off blankets for Project Linus.</li>
