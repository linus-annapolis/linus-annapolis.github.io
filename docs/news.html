    <b>Severna Park Joann Fabrics Closing Soon</b><br>
    The Severna Park Joann Fabrics will be closing in the very near future.  They're currently offering substantial discounts on remaining inventory.
    <p>
    The Severna Park store will no longer be a Project Linus drop-off location. 
      Our other locations will continue to be active. These are the Annapolis Joann Fabrics store and the reception desk of the Severna Park Community Center.
