    we know it!).  Pick up fabric or yarn for your next project, bring blankets that you’re especially proud of 
    for the Show and Tell.

    We still need someone to take over the Saturday meeting programs.  
    The job entails finding someone to present on a knitting, crocheting or 
    quilting topic, handling the door prizes and the show and tell.  
    We’ve got a bin full of items for door prizes.  
    If you like the Saturday programs and want to keep them going, please volunteer!
